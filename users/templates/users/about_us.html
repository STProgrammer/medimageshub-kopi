            <h3>Welcome To MedimagesHub!</h3>
            <p>MedimagesHub is a platform for sharing and viewing medical images build by computer science engineering students
            from UiT The Arctic University of Norway. This project is built as their bachelor thesis project, so it's not meant for
            public use, but just for testing.
            
            <p>Here you can upload, share them and examine the medical images as DICOM files or folders.
            It's a closed plattorm, so not anyone can register here. This is to protect the integrity of the platform,
            make sure only real medical professionals use it.
        
            <p>To start using this system you can contact us at {% url 'users:contact_us' %}
        
            <p>Thanks For Visiting Our Site
